 * This is a chain of three transformations:

 * 	<li>replace diacritical characters with their Latin equivalent ({@link NormaliseDiacriticalMarksTransformer})</li>
 * 	<li>replace all non-alphanumeric characters with {@link #replacement} (default: space)</li>
 * 	<li>replace multiple whitespace occurrences with one whitespace</li>
 * </ul>
 * Returns a trimmed result.

 * This transformer works with Unicode text, unlike {@link StripNonAsciiAlphanumericCharactersTransformer}.
